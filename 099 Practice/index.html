    <h2>Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA) Syllabus</h2>

    <p>Data structure and algorithm (DSA) is a fundamental subject in computer science that focuses on the organization
        and manipulation of data.
        It is essential for solving complex problems efficiently and is a key component of technical interviews.</p>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. It is a data structure that can hold a
        fixed number of elements of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable,
        instead of declaring separate variables for each value.</p>

    <h2>Linked Lists</h2>
    <p>A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next
        node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists can easily grow and shrink in size by adding or removing
        nodes. They are particularly useful for implementing dynamic data structures.</p>

    <h2>Trees</h2>
    <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data
        structure
        that is used to represent relationships between elements. Each tree has a root node, and all other nodes are
        descendants of the root. Trees are widely used in computer science for various applications, including
        representing hierarchical data, implementing search algorithms, and managing sorted data.</p>

    <h3>Binary Trees</h3>
    <p>A binary tree is a special type of tree where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child
        and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science for various applications, including
        expression parsing, searching, and sorting.</p>

    <h4>Binary Search Trees (BST)</h4>
    <p>A binary search tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree that maintains the property of sorted order. In a
        BST, the left child of a node contains only values less than the node's value, and the right child contains only
        values greater than the node's value. This property makes BSTs efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion
        operations.</p>

    <h5>Key properties of Binary Search Trees</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Left Subtree: Contains only nodes with values less than the parent node's value.</li>
        <li>Right Subtree: Contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node's value.</li>
        <li>Unique Values: BSTs typically do not allow duplicate values.</li>
        <li>Dynamic Size: BSTs can grow and shrink in size as elements are added or removed.</li>
    </ul>
